## 1. Purpose and Scope

### This Policy Applies To

- Generative AI systems (text, image, code, audio, video)
- Decision-support systems using machine learning
- Automated workflows with behavioral impact
- Analytics systems influencing user outcomes
- AI-assisted code generation and review
- Prompt-based coordination systems (including Prompt Ninja)
- Any system using third-party AI APIs

### This Policy Does Not Apply To

- Static rule-based automation without learning components
- Traditional search and filter operations
- Manual data analysis performed by humans
- Third-party tools where AI is incidental and non-configurable

---

## 2. Human Accountability

### Ownership Requirements

Every AI system MUST have:

| Role            | Responsibility                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Owner   | Business decisions, user impact, ethical risk acceptance |
| Technical Owner | Implementation, monitoring, incident response            |

Both roles MUST be named individuals. Role assignment by title alone is insufficient.

### Decision Authority

- AI output is advisory only.
- No AI system may make fully autonomous irreversible decisions.
- Human confirmation is REQUIRED before any action affecting:
  - User accounts or access
  - Financial transactions
  - Legal or compliance status
  - Employment decisions
  - Security posture

### Escalation Path

If an AI system produces unexpected or harmful output:

1. Technical Owner is notified immediately.
2. System is suspended if harm is ongoing.
3. Product Owner is notified within 4 hours.
4. Incident is logged per Section 8.

---

## 3. Certainty and Decision Thresholds

### Minimum Confidence Requirements

| Decision Category    | Minimum Confidence | Human Override Required |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Security-affecting   | 95%                | Yes                     |
| Finance-affecting    | 95%                | Yes                     |
| Compliance-affecting | 95%                | Yes                     |
| Access control       | 95%                | Yes                     |
| Employment-related   | 99%                | Yes                     |
| Content generation   | 85%                | No                      |
| Code suggestions     | 85%                | Yes (before merge)      |

### Fallback Behavior

When confidence is below threshold:

1. System MUST NOT proceed autonomously.
2. System MUST request human review.
3. System MUST log the uncertainty event.
4. If human review is unavailable, system MUST fail safe (deny/block/pause).

---

## 4. Bias and Fairness Controls

### Pre-Deployment Requirements

Before any AI feature launches:

- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Training data reviewed for representation gaps
- [ ] Output tested across demographic segments
- [ ] Edge cases documented
- [ ] Mitigation strategies defined

### Post-Deployment Requirements

After launch:

- Bias monitoring runs continuously or at minimum weekly.
- Disparate impact metrics are tracked.
- User feedback channels are monitored for fairness complaints.

### Hard Rule

If bias cannot be mitigated to acceptable levels, the feature MUST be:

1. Redesigned, OR
2. Restricted to lower-risk use cases, OR
3. Disabled entirely

No exceptions.

---

## 5. Privacy and Data Handling

### Core Principles

- Data minimization is the default.
- Collect only what is necessary for the stated purpose.
- Retain only as long as required.

### Consent Requirements

- Explicit consent is REQUIRED before:
  - Using user data for AI training
  - Repurposing data beyond original collection purpose
  - Sharing data with third-party AI providers

### Prohibited Practices

- Silent repurposing of user data
- Training on user content without disclosure
- Storing AI conversation logs beyond operational necessity

### Baseline Compliance

GDPR and CCPA requirements apply as baseline practice regardless of legal jurisdiction.

---

## 6. Transparency

### User Disclosure

Users MUST be informed when:

- They are interacting with an AI system
- AI is making or influencing decisions about them
- Their data is being processed by AI

### Capability Disclosure

Documentation MUST include:

- What the AI system can do
- What the AI system cannot do
- Known limitations and failure modes
- Confidence levels when applicable

### Internal Traceability

- All AI decisions MUST be logged.
- Logs MUST include input, output, confidence, and timestamp.
- Logs MUST be retained for audit purposes (minimum 1 year).

---

## 7. Security and Misuse Prevention

### Required Controls

| Control            | Description                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Prompt hardening   | Resist injection and jailbreak attempts |
| Input validation   | Sanitize and bound all inputs           |
| Abuse detection    | Monitor for patterns of misuse          |
| Rate limiting      | Prevent resource exhaustion             |
| Fail-safe behavior | Default to safe state on error          |

### Explicitly Disallowed Use Cases

AI systems in this project MUST NOT be used for:

- Generating deceptive content (deepfakes, impersonation)
- Surveillance without consent
- Manipulation of user behavior through dark patterns
- Automated weapons or harm systems
- Circumventing security controls
- Generating illegal content

---

## 8. Audit and Incident Handling

### Incident Classification

Ethics incidents are classified as security incidents. They follow the same:

- Severity levels
- Response timelines
- Escalation paths
- Documentation requirements

### Pre-Launch Review

Every AI feature MUST complete ethics review before launch. Review is documented in the PRD under `## AI Ethics & Risk`.

### Ongoing Audits

- Quarterly ethics audits are REQUIRED.
- Audits cover: bias metrics, incident log, user complaints, data handling compliance.
- Audit findings are documented and tracked to resolution.

### Remediation

When issues are found:

1. Issue is logged with severity.
2. Owner is assigned.
3. Timeline is set.
4. Resolution is documented.
5. Verification is performed.

---

## 9. Training and Enforcement

### Mandatory Training

Responsible AI training is REQUIRED for:

- Product managers
- Engineers working on AI features
- Engineering leadership
- Anyone with AI system access in production

Training is completed:

- Before first AI project involvement
- Annually thereafter

### Embedded Checkpoints

Ethics requirements are embedded in:

| Artifact        | Checkpoint                             |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| PRD             | `## AI Ethics & Risk` section required |
| Task generation | Ethics flags in task metadata          |
| Release gate    | Ethics checklist must be complete      |

### Enforcement

- PRs missing ethics section are blocked by CI.
- Releases missing ethics checklist are blocked.
- Violations are escalated to Technical and Product Owners.
